### Hi, I’m Amber. 
I have a health science background and hold a Master of Science Degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Manchester (UK). During my graduate studies I conducted research exclusively within human biological sciences. This involved a combined approach of experimental, theoretical, and computational strategies to complete my interdisciplinary research projects, of which, included the use of data analytic strategies. Besides my research experience, I also have experience in healthcare where I held roles as a Pharmacy Technician and Ophthalmic Technician. 
Currently, I am working as a Private English Teacher and in the process of career transitioning back to the Health Sciences.

Here is a brief summary of my portfolio:

### Languages/Programs:
MySQL, Excel, Tableau, RStudio, Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn,TensorFlow)
